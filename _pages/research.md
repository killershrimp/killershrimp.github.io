#### Machine learning for example generation in pure math
Using reinforcement learning, determine whether a set of matrices generates an algebraic group, and if so, determine the shortest transformation sequence needed to generate any element in the group. Affiliated with the Madison Experimental Math Lab and advised by Karan Srivastava and Prof. Jordan Ellenberg.

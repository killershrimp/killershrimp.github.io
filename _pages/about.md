# About me

Hi! I'm Alex Yun, a sophomore studying Math, CS, and (unofficially) Physics at UW-Madison.

I'm currently professionally interested in robotics/controls and machine learning, especially reinforcement learning. I'm also interested in different applications of machine learning to other fields, especially math and physics/astronomy.

In my free time, I'm a Conservation Co-chair at UW-Madison's [Hoofer Outing Club](https://www.hooferouting.org/) and lead backpacking and rock climbing trips for the Outing and Mountaineering clubs. I also sew ultralight backpacking gear (check out some of my sewing projects [here](/projects)) and run a radio music show focused on paleobiology at [WSUM](https://wsum.org).
